**"Macroevolutionary processes in Turtles (Testudines): a view from biomic specialization and historical climatic changes"**
Authors: Juan S. Thomas, Sara Gamboa, Manuel Hernández Fernández, Oscar Murillo, Jonathan S. Pelegrin

## Overview ##
The analyses in this study explore the macroevolutionary patterns in turtles (Testudines) with a focus on biomic specialization and the impact of historical climatic shifts on diversification. This repository provides all data and scripts necessary to replicate the analyses and figures presented in the manuscript.

## Contents ##
### Data Files ###
- matrix_complete.txt: Contains biomic occupation data for all species of Testudines included in the study. Each row corresponds to a species, and columns represent different biomes, detailing the occupancy for each species across biomic categories.

- matrix_phylogeny.txt: Includes biomic data for the turtle species included in the phylogeny established by Thomson, Spinks, and Shaffer (2021).

## R Scripts ##
The R scripts in this repository are organized to guide users through each major analysis step, including:
